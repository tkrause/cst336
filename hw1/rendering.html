        <h3>Rendering and How it Works</h3>
        <p>
            The method of rendering depends of the type of graphics used. These could be sprites or 3D
            meshes made up of vertices which are points in space connected by edges. Since most modern engines are
            primarily based around meshes, this is the point of view that will be enclosed here.
        </p>
        <p>
            On every render tick, the engine must loop through each of the objects and create an image of the scene.
            This image is then what is displayed to the player.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
            When an object is rendered, the engine converts the vertices into primitive shapes that make up the original shape.
            Typically, the primitives used are similar to squares with four sides known as <strong>quads</strong>. Although
            some engines use triangles. Therefore, a common name for this process is <strong>triangulation</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next the mesh is <strong>rasterized</strong> in which the mesh is split into groups of polygons and flattened into an image.
            At this point, the representation for this object is a series of image fragments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next step the engine takes is <strong>texturing</strong>. This is where the engine applies an image texture to
            color the mesh and add shadows as well as a normal map that gives the depth to the image. This makes it appear to
            have color and be 3D. Groups of the texture are applied to the groups in the image fragments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, the image is stitched together with the rest of the visible game objects and rendered out to the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since an engine can have potentially millions of game objects, we must take care to ensure we only render visible objects.
            Wasting compute resources on objects that are not visible to the player would make the game run significantly slower.
            Most modern engines, use this technique.
