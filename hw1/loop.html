    <h3>The Game Loop</h3>
    <p>
        In order to process the large number of objects in a game, a loop is used.
        This loop is referred to as <strong>the game loop</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For every object, the game must do a number of operations.
        These include <span class="text-focus">collision detection</span>,
        <span class="text-focus">moving/physics</span> (often referred to as a tick), and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, some engines provide the ability to limit the number of frames to save on computation resources.
        The reason for this is that the human eye cannot see above 60 frames a second. Thus rendering can be locked
        on some engines if desired.
    </p>

    <p>
        As can been seen above, the loop continues until the game exits. The loop calculate the time since the
        last iteration known as a <strong>tick</strong>. In every tick, the engine receives the input from the player.
        The engine then updates all the game objects in the world and it's data model. This is also where physics
        processing could be done.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, all of the objects are rendered out to the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        A very simple example of a game loop is available below for reference.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
        double previous = getCurrentTime();
        double lag = 0.0;

        while (true) {
            double current = getCurrentTime();
            double elapsed = current - previous;
            previous = current;
            lag += elapsed;

            processInput();

            while (lag >= MS_PER_UPDATE) {
                update();
                lag -= MS_PER_UPDATE;
            }

            render();
        }
        </code>
