        <p>
            Game engines have become a popular base for many of the games on the market.
            This is due to the time that an engine can save a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Engines allow developers to focus on coding
            their game logic instead of spending time on basic functions that are common to all games.
            Some of the functions that engines provide include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Physics</span> - simulating real world physics from water, to collisions, to gravity</li>
            <li><span>Rendering</span> - converts meshes, textures, and game world data into a frame that can be displayed on screen</li>
            <li><span>Audio</span> - ability to play audio in the game world</li>
            <li><span>Networking</span> - allows for multiple players over the network</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This website will discuss some of the inner workings of a few of these features.</p>
